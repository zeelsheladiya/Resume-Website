        Diamond Management system is C# base Live Desktop application. It stores data in Microsoft SQL Server to manage the data and also for handles the hug data processing and sharing that data through the local network.
        The system generates barcode for each piece of diamond and uses it throughout the process of the diamonds. The system generated reports reduce their daily basis workload. The system is found very helpful by the user to track the diamond at a particular process.

      <P>March 2019</P>
      <p>
        In this project I had made one module with IR senor and light detect sensor and with Arduino. With this sensor I have successfully transferred the data one device to another.
This project is based on one way communication. It has one another module so one is receiver module which receive the data in form of light and second one is sender module which send the data via led light. For the communication I had use Arduino IDE.
